# MLH GLOBAL HACK WEEK AI/ML
Hey Everyone , this is a repositiry of what I have learned from from MLH GLOBAL HACK WEEK .
kindly review it also if possible do try to join mlh for hackathons and such exciting events.

## 💡 AI/ML :- 
Artificial intelligence is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans.

Whereas , Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

## 💻 Exciting Challenges

MLH offers us various Challenges :

- implementing python and using data structures in it .
- creating various projects using python.
- using various ai tools for the help in our projects.
- Projects in ai /ml using python .

## ⚙️ How we built it

- We have mainly used python for programming 
- Also we will getting guidance from our mentors in MLH and learn algorithms for the ai/ml .



## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- It was my first time building a backend with Python , and learning how to use it with machine learning.
- It was a bit difficult to implement the video and file uploads it took a while , but we figured it out .

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete the project in the given time.
- We are proud of the fact that we were able to create and implement a fully functional Backend within a short period of time during this project.

## 📖 What we learned

- How to use python with .
- How to use AI models and diffrent framework with machine learning  .

## 🚀 What's next for 

- Building a mobile app.
- Adding more 3D models.
- Adding more features.
